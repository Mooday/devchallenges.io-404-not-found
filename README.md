Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- This repository has my solution for the 404 not found challenge of devchallenges.io.
- You can see my demo deployed with Vercel.
- I enjoyed this first challenge overall, I knew I've always had little to non knowledge on CSS, so it would turn difficult for me to start giving shape to a web page on my own.
- I learned a lot of CSS in this first challenge, understood in depth a lot of CSS properties and how they actually work. I think this is the first time I make a responsive page on my own.
